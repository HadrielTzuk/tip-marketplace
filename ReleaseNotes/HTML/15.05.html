      REGRESSIVE! Regression Note - The changes in this version might cause regressive changes, due to the changes in the following actions: List Incidents, List Alert Rules, Update Incident Details, Update Incident Labels. In short: Status values "Draft" and "InProgress" are no longer accepted by the api. Instead of "InProgress", "Active" status can be used. Severity value "Critical" is no longer accepted by the api. Json results were changed because updated endpoints return different data.
